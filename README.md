# I Dont Want An F
  Finding a mentor is important to success in college and has many benefits such as providing the student advice, and support and helping them develop good habits. There is a lack of mentorship in colleges as many students find it hard to connect with upperclassmen or faculty. We are making an app to help younger students gain the benefits of mentorship easily. The best way to find a student mentor is through clubs and activities. However, there is no certainty that these places will create a beneficial relationship. Our app creates an open forum that allows students to comment on their past classes. At the same time, current students will be able to post questions and engage in conversations with past students. 

  For each class, there will be a comment and question section. Under the comment section, past students can answer a set of pre-determined questions (EX: What advice would you give a new student) or post a general one. The app will also allow users to rate important aspects of the class such as difficulty, amount of homework, and teaching techniques(Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic). We will also include a home page that will show relevant conversations about your classes. This will allow users to be active in conversations without having to look for them. A similar system would be to rate my professor. We differ as we focus more on the individual classes and make a connection between past students and current students.
