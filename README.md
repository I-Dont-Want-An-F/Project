# vision statement 
  There is a lack of mentorship in colleges. Many students find it hard to connect with upperclassmen or faculty. Finding a mentor is important to success in college and has many benefits such as providing the student advice and support and helping them develop good habits. We are making an app to help younger students gain the benefits of mentorship easily. Currently, the best way to find a student mentor is through clubs and activities. However, there is no certainty that these places will create a beneficial relationship. Our app allows students to connect directly with upperclassmen who have taken the same classes.  
  We plan on achieving this goal by creating an app that allows past students to make comments on their previous courses. They will be able to rate important aspects of the class such as difficulty, amount of homework, and teaching techniques(Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic). Past students will also be able to comment on specific aspects of the class, such as how important are the textbooks, tips for studying, helpful resources, and things they wish they knew. A similar system would be to rate my professor. We differ as we focus more on the individual classes and make a connection between past students and current students.
